2.3.4
 - Fixed several problems with argument validation
 - Added -Wall and cleaned up compiler output
 - Installing rssh.conf as rssh.conf.default
 
2.3.3

 - Fixed escalation problem when not enough permission bits are specified.  As a
   side effect of this, you now MUST have a config file.
 - Fixed the bug in rssh_chroot_helper where, if parsing the config file fails,
   and logging is turned off, rssh_chroot_helper segfaults

2.3.2

 - fixed segfault due to checking the length of variables that I forgot to
   remove from build_arg_vector() since the chroot root exploit fix in 2.3.0 

2.3.1

 - fixed stupid bug that caused rssh not to allow rsync and rdist

2.3.0

 - modified chroot_helper to parse the config file, to avoid arbitrary
   chroot() (and thus root compromise)
 - numerous documentation updates
 - fix for va_start()/va_end()-related segfault on 64-bit architecture
 - small bit of code cleanup

2.2.3

 - added checks for command execution arguments to scp, rdist, rsync

2.2.2

 - string formatting bug fixed in log.c
 - small bug processing chroot path fixed in rsshconf.c
 - -v now outputs pre-configured paths of important files
 - extra debugging messages
 - documentation updates for the wordexp() shell problem

2.2.1

 - added missing code for parsing per-user options

2.2.0

 - fixed a security hole where chrooted users could enumerate files outside
   the jail
 - fixed a bug handling sftp-server checking
 - added support for cvs, rdist, and rsync
 - documentation clarifications and updates.
 - added conf_convert.sh to convert old rssh.conf files to new format
 - added mkchroot.sh to set up a chroot jail (mostly for Red Hat systems)
 - reversed the direction of the ChangeLog file...  :)

2.1.1

 - updated build environment to facilitate building RPMs

2.1.0

 - added per-user configuration
 - fixed a number of heretofore unnoticed bugs in the parser and elsewhere
 - added examples to the config file
 - updated documentation

2.0.4

 - fixed quote processing in config file parser
 - fixed command line argvec building for args with spaces
 - cleaned up a number of other little verbiage things, etc.
 - changed default shell opts to allow only scp if config file doesn't exist

2.0.3

 - added SECURITY file to the distribution
 - removed references to scpsh and sftpsh from README
 - changed strcmp in main.c to use PATH_SCP rather than scp
 - made rssh_chroot_helper check # of args, plus minor log mods to support
 - minor fixes in CHROOT hints file
 - actually called umask() to set the umask...
 - added patches to configure.ac for compiling on non-GNU platforms

2.0.2

 - another bug with scp

2.0.1

 - fixed bug preventing scp from working
 - documentation update for using chroot jails
 - updated the INSTALL file with hints for Solaris 

2.0.0

Some code clean-up, and added config file, with support for:

  - setting default umask
  - configuring whether scp and/or sftp are allowed
  - setting the syslog facility to which to log
  - support for chroot jails

...and there was much rejoicing.  All configuration options are currently
global.  In the next major release of rssh, they will be configurable on a
per-user basis (which will override global settings).

Added rssh_chroot_helper for (hopefully) implementing the chroot jail
securely.

1.0.1

Added support to configure to check for OpenSSH 3.5, and disables static
compilation if found

1.0.0
