rssh (2.3.4-7ubuntu0.1) bionic-security; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE: Command injection
    - debian/patches/0009-Verify-scp-command-options.patch: Validate
      the allowed scp command line and only permit the flags used in
      server mode and only a single argument, to attempt to prevent use
      of ssh options to run arbitrary code on the server.  This will
      break scp -3 to a system running rssh, which seems like an
      acceptable loss. (LP #1815935)
    - debian/patches/0007-Verify-rsync-command-options.patch: Tighten
      validation of the rsync command line to require --server be the
      first argument, which should prevent initiation of an outbound rsync
      command from the server, which in turn might allow execution of
      arbitrary code via ssh configuration similar to scp.

      Also reject rsync --daemon and --config command-line options, which
      can be used to run arbitrary commands.  Thanks, Nick Cleaton.

      Do not stop checking the rsync command line at --, since this can
      be an argument to some other option and later arguments may still
      be interpreted as options.  In the few cases where one needs to
      rsync to files named things like --rsh, the client can use ./--rsh
      instead.  Thanks, Nick Cleaton.
    - debian/patches/0010-Check-command-line-after-chroot.patch: Unset
      the HOME environment variable when running rsync to prevent popt
      (against which rsync is linked) from loading a ~/.popt
      configuration file, which can run arbitrary commands on the server
      or redefine command-line options to bypass argument checking.
      Thanks, Nick Cleaton.

rssh (2.3.4-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Change the specified mode of conf_convert in the Debian patch to be
    0644, since dpkg doesn't support modes the way that Git does and will
    ignore the mode anyway.  This mismatch was breaking use of dgit for
    this package.

rssh (2.3.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Merges fixes/command-line-checking.
    - Fix a (probably not exploitable) flaw in determining the command
      to run from the provided command line.
  * Adjust the installation process for the new upstream behavior of
    installing rssh.conf as rssh.conf.default.  The Debian package
    continues to install it as /etc/rssh.conf.
  * Add new logcheck ignore line for a new upstream log message.
  * Fix the log level for a notice of global svnserve access to use debug,
    matching the (patched) behavior for the other program types.
  * Fix the regular expression in the previous change to correctly match a
    literal period instead of any character.  (This fix is not critical,
    but adds further defense in depth.)  Remove an unused variable to
    silence compiler warnings.  Patch from Tomas Hoger.
  * Change debian/watch to use the sf.net redirector.

rssh (2.3.3-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix several flaws in validation of rsync options.  Ensure --server
    cannot be hidden from the server by putting it after -- or as the
    argument to another option.  Verify that the -e option's value matches
    expectations rather than trying to look for invalid -e option values.
    (CVE-2012-2251)
  * Reject the rsync --rsh option even if it does not contain a trailing
    equal sign.  (CVE-2012-2252)

rssh (2.3.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force libexecdir to /usr/lib/rssh.  This is not a library package and
    has no reason to be using the multiarch paths, but picked up the
    modification to libexecdir as a side effect of the debhelper
    compatibility level change.  (Closes: #663011)

    rolling our own equivalent.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 05 Feb 2012 19:51:55 -0800

  * New upstream release.
    - Exit with non-zero status when fatal() is called.
    - Merges Debian fixes/config-parse-fatal, fixes/man-page-hyphen, and
      fixes/missing-config patches.
  * In the example mkchroot script, also check for and copy over the
    dependencies of any of the NSS libraries we copy over.  This picks up
    the libnsl library, which is now required.  Print out a warning that
    mkchroot doesn't copy over any of the libraries required for other
    supporting programs (rsync, etc.), only those for scp and sftp.
    (Closes: #611878)
  * Update debian/copyright to the current DEP-5 format.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8.
  * Update to standards version 3.9.1 (no changes required).

rssh (2.3.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * If parsing the configuration file fails, abort with an error rather
    than continuing on and applying the defaults, since the defaults may
    be wrong for the current user.  Patch from Jon Barber.
  * Fix spelling error (seperate for separate) in rssh man page.
  * Remove version from openssh-server dependency since it was older than
    oldstable.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.0 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 06 Jul 2010 18:07:47 -0700

  * Switch to 3.0 (quilt) source format.
    - Remove build dependency on quilt and debian/rules machinery.
  * Remove all of the files touched by autoreconf -i.

rssh (2.3.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package is now maintained using Git and TopGit.  A quilt
    patch series is exported from TopGit branches for the final Debian
    package.  Update debian/README.source, the Vcs-* control fields, and
    debian/rules accordingly.
  * Add support for svnserve (Subversion).  This requires a change in the
    format of /etc/rssh.conf to add an additional binary digit to the
    permissions field.  /etc/rssh.conf will be automatically updated as
    part of the package upgrade using /usr/share/rssh/conf_convert.  Patch
    from Davide Scola.  (Closes: #284756)
  * In mkchroot, also install /dev/zero in the chroot.  Noted in an
    updated patch from Ross Davis sent to the rssh-discuss list.
  * Remove postrm script that removed rssh from /etc/shells.  We do that
    in postinst on upgrade and have for some time, so this maintainer
    script was unnecessary.
  * Convert to the proposed new copyright format.
  * Swap Maintainer and Uploaders, making me the primary maintainer.  I've
    done all of the recent uploads.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V7.
    - Use rule minimization with overrides.
    - Move install, examples, and manpage lists into separate files.
    - Add --enable-static if "static" is in DEB_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS rather
      than requiring the variable be set to exactly --enable-static.
    - Remove unnecessary debian/dirs.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.1 (no changes required).
  * Translation updates:
    - Spanish, thanks Francisco Javier Cuadrado.  (Closes: #509356)

rssh (2.3.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * The upstream mkchroot script uses echo -e, so make it a /bin/bash
    script, which is less invasive than rewriting all of the echo
    statements to printf.  Thanks, Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #489653)
  * Update standards version to 3.8.0.
    - Add a README.source file pointing to the quilt documentation.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jul 2008 13:09:38 -0700

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 27 May 2008 19:48:25 -0700

rssh (2.3.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow the -e option to rsync in conjunction with --server when it
    contains a protocol version.  As of version three, rsync reused the -e
    option to pass protocol information.  (Closes: #471803)
  * Avoid a segfault when logging is disabled and the configuration file
    could not be opened.  Thanks, Thomas Liske.  (Closes: #470262)
  * Update the example mkchroot.sh script, thanks to Carsten Maass and
    proctor mcduff.  (Closes: #465528)
    - Fix the parsing of ldd output.
    - Create /dev/null and /dev/log in the chroot.
    - Update the sftp-server and rssh_chroot_helper paths for Debian.
    - Copy /etc/ld.* files recursively.
    - Add better error handling.
  * Suggest makejail for the chroot setup.  (Closes: #458563)
  * Clean all patches of extraneous headers and timestamps.
  * Mention in README.Debian that the upstream maintainer doesn't plan
    future releases and therefore major new work (such as Subversion
    support) may require taking over upstream maintenance.
  * Add a Homepage control field and drop the XS-* prefixes for the Vcs
    control fields.
  * Add the upstream copyright statement and the complete license to
    debian/copyright.
  * Add a watch file.
  * debian/rules cleanup:
    - Use a stamp file for installation.
    - Depend on the quilt stamp file to prevent repeating configure.
    - Use touch $@ to create stamp files.
    - Simplify the rule structure.
  * Update standards version to 3.7.3 (no changes required).

rssh (2.3.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the logic for checking whether the setuid status of
    rssh_chroot_helper was overridden by the sysadmin.  The previous logic
    would only make it setuid if dpkg-statoverride couldn't be found.
    Thanks, Peter Baumann.  (Closes: #425431)
  * Don't add rssh to /etc/shells; restricted shells should not be listed
    there.  Remove it from /etc/shells if upgrading from an older version.
    Also, we don't need to conditionalize running add-shell and
    remove-shell, since debianutils is essential and has had add-shell and
    remove-shell since etch.  (Closes: #424672)
  * Remove the obsolete security note from the config script.
  * Fix the build system to not run configure twice.
  * Add XS-Vcs-Svn and XS-Vcs-Browser control fields.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 21 May 2007 19:10:54 -0700

rssh (2.3.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrite the prompt for a setuid rssh_chroot_helper to follow the
    DevRef debconf style guidelines and not mention an incorrect path in
    /usr/bin.  (Closes: #421000)
  * Don't use config.status as a stamp file, since then the ordering of
    removal causes make clean to fail after a build.  (Closes: #424281)
  * Translation updates:
    - Swedish, thanks Daniel Nylander.

  * In the example mkchroot script, warn that /etc/passwd is copied into
    the chroot and the user may wish to remove unnecessary users and
    sensitive information.  (Closes: #366655)
  * Let debhelper handle debconf purging in postrm properly, fixing
    purging failures when debconf isn't installed.  (Closes: #417009)
  * Remove debconf update notes for versions that are now older than
    oldstable.  (Closes: #388957)
  * Improve the README.Debian security information.  Move the details from
    the debconf security note to here to eliminate the rest of the debconf
    note abuse.
  * Fix incorrect hyphens in the rssh man page.
  * Recognize reconfigure in postinst.
  * Don't die on unknown actions in maintainer scripts.
  * Only remove rssh from /etc/shells on remove and purge, not upgrade.
  * Use $(CURDIR) instead of `pwd` in debian/rules.
  * Update standards version to 3.7.2 (no changes required).
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V5.
  * Translation updates:

  * New co-maintainer.
  * New upstream release.
    - Incorporates fixes from NMU.  (Closes: #346322, #355935, #357715)
    - Incorporates missing va_end also fixed in NMU.  (Closes: #339531)
  * Don't compress example scripts.  (Closes: #333923)
  * Mention chroot and jail in the rssh description.  (Closes: #335475)
  * Add libnss_compat* to the chroot script.  (Closes: #335384)
  * Drop the ssh-krb5 alternative; it doesn't use the right sftp-server
    path.  Add Suggests pointing to the other supported commands.
  * Drop the configuration caution from the package description; it's in
    the man page and the long description isn't supposed to include
    configuration information for the package.
  * Rework README.Debian a little to point to the rssh man page instead of
    SECURITY (upstream moved the security notes there) and emphasize
    reading the documentation before using the package.
  * Update logcheck rules.
  * debian/rules and debian/control cleanup.
    - Switch to quilt for patches.  It works essentially the same as the
      script the package was using but is more standard and is the current
      recommended tool.
    - Run dh_shlibdeps to pick up proper dependency information.
    - Get the debconf dependency from debhelper.
    - Use debian/compat instead of setting DH_COMPAT.
    - Use dh_installman instead of the deprecated dh_installmanpages.
    - Remove duplicate rssh.docs configuration file.
    - Don't install config.{guess,sub}; configure doesn't use them.
    - Rename NEWS.Debian to NEWS so that debhelper installs it.
    - Install logcheck rules with debhelper.
    - Simplify unused rules and remove some boilerplate.
  * Translation updates.
