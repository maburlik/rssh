rssh (2.3.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of the rssh package adds support for Subversion by adding
  an additional configuration parameter that, if set, allows an rssh user
  to run svnserve -t.

  This support requires changing the /etc/rssh.conf file format to add an
  additional binary digit to the permissions field.  The package will
  attempt to make that change automatically during the upgrade, disabling
  svnserve for all users by default, but you may want to double-check the
  resulting /etc/rssh.conf file to be sure it's correct.

rssh (2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This release contains 2 major updates:
    - A minor security fix (which results only in disclosing some information
      in chrooted jails about the non chrooted environment).
    - New support for cvs, rdist and rsync. Due to the new protocols, a 
      modification needs to be done in the configuration file, which has not
      been automated in the installation scripts. Read the packages' README
      for more information.
