_Description: Do you want rssh_chroot_helper to be installed setuid root?
 If you plan to use chroot jails for the users using rssh, the program
 /usr/lib/rssh/rssh_chroot_helper has to be installed setuid root so that
 it can chroot into the jail when the user connects.  If you are not using
 chroot jails, it's better to not install setuid root programs you don't
 need.
 .
 If in doubt, install it without setuid root.  If you later decide to use
 chroot jails, you can change this configuration by running
 dpkg-reconfigure rssh.
