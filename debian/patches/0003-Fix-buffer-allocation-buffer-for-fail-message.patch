Subject: Fix buffer allocation buffer for fail message

The failure log message when the user isn't permitted to run the
command they're attempting includes a summary of the commands the
user is allowed to run.  The allocation for that string was not
reserving space for the nul byte at the end of the string, causing
a one-byte overwrite past the end of the string.
